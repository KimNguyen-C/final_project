        My passion for coding began during a foundational class in college where I discovered the art of bringing ideas to life through code. Since then, I’ve been continuously learning how to build intuitive user interfaces and craft websites that not only look great but also feel great to use. Inspired by innovative platforms like the Apple website, I strive to create designs that captivate and engage audiences.

            When I’m not immersed in lines of code, you’ll likely find me behind a camera lens, exploring my passion for photography, or diving into new languages and cultures. I also enjoy connecting with others who share a love for innovation and creativity.</p>
